# Lock-Tin

### Description

Lock-Tin is a program designed to help univeristy students plan their days using calenders of school or club events as well as the dining hall menu or traffic on campus. The project allows for students to share useful information such as   events dates, menu items or the library status for others to access. This allows students stay up to date and to decide whether they want to visit the dining hall or library. Lock-Tin has many other features planned and will hopefully be added in the near future.
